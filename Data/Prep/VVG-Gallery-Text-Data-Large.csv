"s0005V1962","F0082","JH0764","The Potato Eaters oil on canvas, 82 cm x 114 cm Credits (obliged to state): Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam (Vincent van Gogh Foundation) Van Gogh saw the Potato Eaters as a showpiece, for which he deliberately chose a difficult composition to prove he was on his way to becoming a good figure painter. The painting had to depict the harsh reality of country life, so he gave the peasants coarse faces and bony, working hands. He wanted to show in this way that they have tilled the earth themselves with these hands they are putting in the dish ... that they have thus honestly earned their food. He painted the five figures in earth colours something like the colour of a really dusty potato, unpeeled of course. The message of the painting was more important to Van Gogh than correct anatomy or technical perfection. He was very pleased with the result: yet his painting drew considerable criticism because its colours were so dark and the figures full of mistakes. Nowadays, the Potato Eaters is one of Van Goghs most famous works. 82 cm x 114 cm, 100 cm x 133 cm Sent by the artist to his brother Theo van Gogh, Paris, at the beginning of May 1885; after Theos death on 25 January 1891, inherited by his widow, Jo van Gogh-Bonger, and their son, Vincent Willem van Gogh, Paris; administered until her death on 2 September 1925 by Jo van Gogh-Bonger, Bussum/Amsterdam/Laren; transferred by Vincent Willem van Gogh, Laren, on 10 July 1962 to the Vincent van Gogh Foundation, Amsterdam; agreement concluded on 21 July 1962 between the Vincent van Gogh Foundation and the State of the Netherlands, in which the preservation and management of the collection, and its placing in the Rijksmuseum Vincent van Gogh, to be realized in Amsterdam, is entrusted to the State; given on loan until the opening of the museum on 2 June 1973 to the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam; on permanent loan to the Rijksmuseum Vincent van Gogh from 2 June 1973 and at the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam, since 1 July 1994.","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","https://vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection?Type=painting","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","https://vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection?Date=1885","localhost","localhost","localhost","https://vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection?Place=Nuenen","localhost","localhost","localhost"

Couples in love are strolling under the young chestnut trees and sitting along the winding paths. He used a free variation on the technique of the Pointillists. They built up their compositions from dots of paint. Van Gogh instead applied small brushstrokes of varying length in different directions. This helped him to create the effect of a radiant spring day, which fit the sense of intimacy and togetherness he wished to express. He too longed for a wife and a family, but he had the most impossible love affairs. He eventually resigned himself to the situation; he was devoted to his art. 75.0 cm x 113.0 cm, 95.0 cm x 132.4 cm Left by the artist at the apartment of his brother Theo van Gogh, Paris, in the second half of May 1887; after Theos death on 25 January 1891, inherited by his widow, Jo van Gogh-Bonger, and their son, Vincent Willem van Gogh, Paris; administered until her death on 2 September 1925 by Jo van Gogh-Bonger, Bussum/Amsterdam/Laren; given on loan by Vincent Willem van Gogh, Laren to the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam, from 1927 to 1930; given on loan by Vincent Willem van Gogh to the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam, since 22 October 1931; donated by Vincent Willem van Gogh on 11 March 1952 to the (1st) Vincent van Gogh Foundation, Laren; transferred on 28 December 1960 by the (1st) Vincent van Gogh Foundation to the Theo van Gogh Foundation, Laren; agreement concluded on 21 July 1962 between the (2nd) Vincent van Gogh Foundation, Amsterdam, and the State of the Netherlands, in which the preservation and management of the collection, and its placing in the Rijksmuseum Vincent van Gogh, to be realized in Amsterdam, is entrusted to the State; donated on 21 July 1962 by the Theo van Gogh Foundation to the Vincent van Gogh Foundation; given on loan until the opening of the museum on 2 June 1973 to the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam; on permanent loan to the Rijksmuseum Vincent van Gogh from 2 June 1973 and at the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam, since 1 July 1994.","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","https://vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection?Type=painting","localhost","localhost","localhost","https://vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection?Genre=cityscape","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","https://vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection?Date=1887","localhost","localhost","localhost","https://vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection?Place=Paris","localhost"

He showed that he was a modern artist by using a new painting style, with bright, almost unblended colours. The palette contains the complementary colour pairs red/green, yellow/purple and blue/orange precisely the colours Van Gogh used for this painting. He laid these pairs down side by side to intensify one another: the blue of his smock, for instance, and the orange-red of his beard. Self-Portrait as a Painter was the last work Van Gogh produced in Paris; the city had exhausted him both mentally and physically.

All that is missing are the washerwomen who were included in an earlier version. Van Gogh carefully organised his composition. He chose a place for his easel where he could paint the patch of land with the road in the foreground as a large diagonal leading into the left background.

All in all, he made more than 30 drawings and paintings on this theme. He painted this sower in the autumn of 1888. At the time, Van Gogh was working together with Paul Gauguin (1848-1903). Gauguin believed that in his work Van Gogh should draw less on reality and more on his imagination. Here, Van Gogh used colours meant to express emotion and passion. He assigned the leading roles to the greenish-yellow of the sky and the purple of the field.

He did them in Arles, in the south of France, in 1888 and 1889. Vincent painted a total of five large canvases with sunflowers in a vase, with three shades of yellow and nothing else. In this way, he demonstrated that it was possible to create an image with numerous variations of a single colour, without any loss of eloquence. The sunflower paintings had a special significance for Van Gogh: they communicated gratitude, he wrote. He hung the first two in the room of his friend, the painter Paul Gauguin, who came to live with him for a while in the Yellow House. Gauguin was impressed by the sunflowers, which he thought were completely Vincent. Van Gogh had already painted a new version during his friends stay and Gauguin later asked for one as a gift, which Vincent was reluctant to give him.

The green shutters in this painting of the square show where he lived. Shortly after moving into the Yellow House, he sent Theo a description and sketch of his painting of it: its tremendous, these yellow houses in the sunlight and then the incomparable freshness of the blue. The work, which Van Gogh himself called The Street, records the artists immediate surroundings: he often ate at the restaurant on the left, and the home of his friend, the postman Joseph Roulin, lay just beyond the second railway bridge. Vincent had finally found a place at the Yellow House where he could not only paint but also have his friends come to stay.

He prepared the room himself with simple furniture and with his own work on the wall. The bright colours were meant to express absolute repose or sleep. Research shows that the strongly contrasting colours we see in the work today are the result of discolouration over the years. The walls and doors, for instance, were originally purple rather than blue.. The apparently odd angle of the rear wall, meanwhile, is not a mistake on Van Goghs part the corner really was skewed. The rules of perspective seem not to have been accurately applied throughout the painting, but this was a deliberate choice. Vincent told Theo in a letter that he had deliberately flattened the interior and left out the shadows so that his picture would resemble a Japanese print.

Van Gogh used powerful colour combinations in this painting: the blue sky contrasts with the yellow-orange wheat, while the red of the path is intensified by the green bands of grass. 50.5 cm x 103 cm, 69.8 cm x 122.7 cm With his brother Theo van Gogh, Paris, after mid-July 1890; after Theos death on 25 January 1891, inherited by his widow, Jo van Gogh-Bonger, and their son, Vincent Willem van Gogh, Paris; administered until her death on 2 September 1925 by Jo van Gogh-Bonger, Bussum/Amsterdam/Laren; given on loan by Vincent Willem van Gogh, Laren to the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam, since 22 October 1931; transferred by Vincent Willem van Gogh on 10 July 1962 to the Vincent van Gogh Foundation, Amsterdam; agreement concluded on 21 July 1962 between the Vincent van Gogh Foundation and the State of the Netherlands, in which the preservation and management of the collection, and its placing in the Rijksmuseum Vincent van Gogh, to be realized in Amsterdam, is entrusted to the State; given on loan until the opening of the museum on 2 June 1973 to the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam; on permanent loan to the Rijksmuseum Vincent van Gogh from 2 June 1973 and at the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam, since 1 July 1994.","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","https://vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection?Type=painting","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","https://vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection?Genre=animal art","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","https://vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection?Date=1890","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost"

Almond trees flower early in the spring making them a symbol of new life. Van Gogh borrowed the subject, the bold outlines and the positioning of the tree in the picture plane from Japanese printmaking. The painting was a gift for his brother Theo and sister-in-law Jo, who had just had a baby son, Vincent Willem. In the letter announcing the new arrival, Theo wrote: As we told you, well name him after you, and Im making the wish that he may be as determined and as courageous as you.

Only after that do you realise that it shows a slope with tree trunks and roots. These are trees used for timber, growing in a marl quarry. Such quarries could be found around Auvers (FR). The work was not entirely completed. That explains its unfinished appearance. It is probably Van Goghs very last painting.

He realised in 1885 that he needed to build them up from large round forms rather than contours. This burly peasant woman is a successful example. The proportions may not be accurate, but this was deliberate: Van Gogh wanted to make the drawing more expressive.

This is most likely the Porte de Clichy one of 25 gates leading into the French capital. The lively cityscape is filled with little figures and details like the horse-drawn tram. Van Gogh drew inspiration for this drawing from the crowded street scenes in Japanese prints. The bright colours of those prints also stimulated his creativity. This cityscape is one of the few drawings he made in Paris. He mostly worked in oil paint on canvas during his time there and developed a brighter, more modern colour palette.

They were poverty-stricken and had to work very hard to earn a living. He made sixteen large drawings of them, including this one in watercolour and ink. The loom fills almost the entire picture. Van Gogh devoted considerable attention to representing the machine accurately. It was hard, because in the small rooms one cant get far enough away to draw the loom, he wrote.

Because he left large areas of the paper blank, the colour white plays a large role in the scene. 44.3 cm x 54.0 cm With his brother Theo van Gogh, Paris, after May 1890; after Theos death on 25 January 1891, inherited by his widow, Jo van Gogh-Bonger, and their son, Vincent Willem van Gogh, Paris; administered until her death on 2 September 1925 by Jo van Gogh-Bonger, Bussum/Amsterdam/Laren; given on loan by Vincent Willem van Gogh, Laren to the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam, since 22 October 1931; transferred by Vincent Willem van Gogh on 10 July 1962 to the Vincent van Gogh Foundation, Amsterdam; agreement concluded on 21 July 1962 between the Vincent van Gogh Foundation and the State of the Netherlands, in which the preservation and management of the collection, and its placing in the Rijksmuseum Vincent van Gogh, to be realized in Amsterdam, is entrusted to the State; given on loan until the opening of the museum on 2 June 1973 to the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam; on permanent loan to the Rijksmuseum Vincent van Gogh from 2 June 1973 and at the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam, since 1 July 1994.","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","https://vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection?Type=drawing","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","https://vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection?Date=1890","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost"

He wanted to use the dead pollard willow beneath a threatening sky to create a sombre landscape with a railway signalman who, according to the artist, is thinking: how gloomy it is today.. . Pollard Willow is a detailed watercolour. On the horizon, Van Gogh carefully drew the railway depot at Rijnspoor station in pen and ink. The lampposts, the locomotive, from which smoke rises, and the small figure of the signalman with his flag are all rendered with great precision. He then completed the scene using watercolours. The path running alongside the willow is black with coal dust.. . Van Gogh produced his first large, fully-fledged watercolours in The Hague and this was the one with which he was most satisfied.

The tower had remained standing when the church collapsed a century earlier, but at the time of this painting it was being demolished. The steeple is already gone. In a letter to his brother Theo, Vincent explained what he wanted this painting to express. He saw the dilapidated church tower as a symbol of the ephemeral nature of religion.

Van Gogh used the same canvas more than once on other occasions too. It was a way of saving money. 38.1 cm x 45.3 cm, 55.7 cm x 63.6 cm Left by the artist at the apartment of his brother Theo van Gogh, Paris, sometime between September and November 1886; after Theos death on 25 January 1891, inherited by his widow, Jo van Gogh-Bonger, and their son, Vincent Willem van Gogh, Paris; administered until her death on 2 September 1925 by Jo van Gogh-Bonger, Bussum/Amsterdam/Laren; 1926 given on loan by Vincent Willem van Gogh, Laren to the Mesdag Museum, The Hague; given on loan by Vincent Willem van Gogh to the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam, since 22 October 1931; transferred by Vincent Willem van Gogh, on 10 July 1962 to the Vincent van Gogh Foundation, Amsterdam; agreement concluded on 21 July 1962 between the Vincent van Gogh Foundation and the State of the Netherlands, in which the preservation and management of the collection, and its placing in the Rijksmuseum Vincent van Gogh, to be realized in Amsterdam, is entrusted to the State; given on loan until the opening of the museum on 2 June 1973 to the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam; on permanent loan to the Rijksmuseum Vincent van Gogh from 2 June 1973 and at the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam, since 1 July 1994.","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","https://vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection?Type=painting","localhost","https://vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection?Genre=still life","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","https://vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection?Date=1886","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","https://vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection?Place=Paris","localhost"

That was already true in Van Goghs day. But the hill of Montmartre then had buildings only on one side. Here, Van Gogh painted the other side. You can see quarries and a view of the mills, which had already been absorbed into the built-up part of the district. In the foreground is a pile of wood; behind it are blocks of stone. Van Gogh was not the only artist to paint this picturesque place. He hoped that if he depicted a familiar scene, his painting would sell well.

In his day, Montmartre was still a partly rural area with allotment gardens and farms. Van Gogh hoped that this subject would sell well. He took the fresh, pure colours the white of the fields and bright blue of the sheds from contemporary French art. To render sunlight in this landscape, Van Gogh used highly diluted oil paint. This resulted in a translucent, matt effect. He chose a canvas with an unusual, elongated shape. That creates an effect like that of a wide-angle lens.

It is clear from the work that he had studied the technique of the Pointillists and applied it in his own, original way. He placed the short stripes of paint in different directions. Where they follow the outline of his head, they form a kind of halo. The painting is also one of Van Goghs boldest colour experiments in Paris. He placed complementary colours alongside one another using long brushstrokes: blue and orange in the background, and red and green in the beard and eyes. The colours intensify one another. The red pigment has faded, so the purple strokes are now blue, which means the contrast with the yellow is less powerful. 44.5 cm x 37.2 cm, 65 cm x 57 cm Left by the artist at the apartment of his brother Theo van Gogh, Paris, September-October 1887; after Theos death on 25 January 1891, inherited by his widow, Jo van Gogh-Bonger, and their son, Vincent Willem van Gogh, Paris; administered until her death on 2 September 1925 by Jo van Gogh-Bonger, Bussum/Amsterdam/Laren; transferred by Vincent Willem van Gogh, Laren, on 10 July 1962 to the Vincent van Gogh Foundation, Amsterdam; agreement concluded on 21 July 1962 between the Vincent van Gogh Foundation and the State of the Netherlands, in which the preservation and management of the collection, and its placing in the Rijksmuseum Vincent van Gogh, to be realized in Amsterdam, is entrusted to the State; given on loan until the opening of the museum on 2 June 1973 to the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam; on permanent loan to the Rijksmuseum Vincent van Gogh from 2 June 1973 and at the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam, since 1 July 1994.","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","https://vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection?Type=painting","https://vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection?Genre=portrait","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","https://vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection?Date=1887","localhost","localhost","localhost","https://vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection?Place=Paris","localhost"

The saucers under the glass on the table betray the fact that she is on her second beer. Drinking and smoking in a cafe was not appropriate for respectable ladies.

After a few weeks, spring came. Full of enthusiasm, he began a series of studies of trees in blossom. When he saw the paintings side by side, he had the idea of combining them into triptychs. In a triptych, three works are combined into one harmonious whole. Van Gogh was familiar with this idea from Japanese prints. Van Gogh went on to produce no fewer than fourteen paintings of fruit trees in blossom in the space of a month. He hoped his orchard paintings would sell.

Compared to the irregular surface of the sandy beach, theyve been painted in an overly two-dimensional way. The boats are made up of areas of uniform colour within strong outlines. Furthermore, the boats dont cast shadows on the beach. These stylistic elements were familiar to Van Gogh from his collection of Japanese prints.

Van Gogh combined the azure blue of the sky with yellow and green tones for the land to capture the atmosphere of a summers day. He worked in the wheatfields for days at a time under the burning sun. This was an immensely productive period, in which he completed ten paintings and five drawings in just over a week, until a heavy storm brought the harvest season to an end. Van Gogh wanted to show peasant life and work on the land a recurring theme in his art and painted several stages of the harvest. We see a half mowed wheatfield, ladders and several carts. A reaper works in the background, which is why he titled the work La moisson or The Harvest.

This work illustrates what he had learned in Paris. There he had encountered a variety of new art movements, including Impressionism and Pointillism. As soon as he arrived in the southern city of Arles, he began painting his surroundings. He tried to use everything he had learned to find a style of his own.

He often sat there painting. This is an oil study he made. He was always looking for new points of view among the crooked tree trunks.

He was fascinated by the ever-changing colour of the olive trees and tried to find a good way of painting their irregular growth. His solution was to use swirling brushstrokes, bold outlines around the trunks and stylized blue shadows. Van Gogh made his paintings of olive groves just after his friends Paul Gauguin and Emile Bernard had painted a number of religious scenes. They created those works from their imaginations. Van Gogh disagreed with that approach. He felt that reality should always be the starting point: My ambition is truly limited to a few clods of earth, some sprouting wheat.

In the autumn he made this painting, which he called a leaf-fall. The seasonal atmosphere is suggested by the colours, the lone walker and the leaves blown by the wind. Van Gogh chose a high viewpoint for the painting, so the outlines of the trunks are cut off by the upper and lower edges.

The modern novels and burning candle on the green seat cushion symbolize the character of the absent painter. Using mainly red and green hues, Van Gogh tried to suggest the mood of night. He also painted a pendant of this work with a daytime atmosphere: his own simple peasant chair in bright yellow and blue. The two paintings represent the different personalities of the two artists, who quarrelled and went their separate ways soon afterwards. Van Gogh skilfully captured the bluish shadows and reflected light on the polished wood of the chair.

The spool might have been this bobbin winder a device used to wind spun thread onto a bobbin or spool.

The execution of the painting is deft, smooth and thin so thin in places that the ground layer and transparent green base colour are still visible. Van Gogh was fascinated by lighting effects, and there is a powerful element of backlighting in this painting. He uses touches of light grey to represent the fall of light on the bobbin winder, while the white and yellow highlights intensify the contrasts between light and shade.. . The objects were probably lit from three sides: not only by the window on the left, but also from above and by a lamp in front of the basket to the left.

He concluded, The different effects produced by atmospheric variations make it a subject for I dont know how many paintings. Van Gogh adopted an unusual approach to this view. On part of the canvas, he used the stippling technique he had learned from the Pointillists. He painted other parts loosely and freely.

Vincent van Gogh painted about 35 self-portraits in total, most of them in Paris. For him, this was a way of practising portrait painting. His intention was not to portray himself as realistically as possible. He used the Neo-Impressionist style here, with short, rough brushstrokes.

He painted The Bridge at Courbevoie in a single session, focusing on the reflections in the water. He was less concerned with using correct perspective or with the proportions of the human figures. Van Gogh used dashes of paint in all sorts of colours, side by side and sometimes layered. This was his own free variation on Pointillism. That method was familiar to him from the work of artists such as Georges Seurat (1859-1891) and Paul Signac (1863-1935).

Van Gogh called these humble farmhouses peoples nests. He felt they had a sheltering quality. This cottage contains two houses with two front doors and a shared chimney. That type of dwelling was then on the brink of disappearing. The thing struck me greatly; those two cottages, half decayed under one and the same thatched roof, reminded me of a couple of worn-out old folk who make up just one single being and whom one sees supporting each other, he wrote. The subject continued to fascinate him. Four years later, in France, he returned to drawing and painting old houses.

Van Gogh described this decorative painting to his friend, the artist Paul Gauguin, as follows: nothing more than ears of wheat, green-blue stalks, long, ribbon-like leaves, under a sheen of green and pink; ears of wheat, yellowing slightly, with an edge made pale pink by the dusty manner of flowering.

Van Gogh painted the junction that he often crossed. Rue Lepic, where he lived with his brother Theo, began on the right, just beyond the edge of the picture. In Paris, Van Gogh was exposed to the latest art movements of his day, Impressionism and Pointillism. This gradually led him to use lighter colours. He also experimented with a variety of painting techniques. His style of brushwork, with many dashes of paint side by side, shows the influence of these art movements. In the same paintings, he also tried out diluted oil paint. 46 cm x 55.5 cm, 64 cm x 73 cm Left by the artist at the apartment of his brother Theo van Gogh, Paris, sometime between March and mid April 1887; after Theos death on 25 January 1891, inherited by his widow, Jo van Gogh-Bonger, and their son, Vincent Willem van Gogh, Paris; administered until her death on 2 September 1925 by Jo van Gogh-Bonger, Bussum/Amsterdam/Laren; given on loan by Jo van Gogh-Bonger to the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam, from 1917 to 1919; 1926 given on loan by Vincent Willem van Gogh, Laren to the Mesdag Museum, The Hague; transferred by Vincent Willem van Gogh, on 10 July 1962 to the Vincent van Gogh Foundation, Amsterdam; agreement concluded on 21 July 1962 between the Vincent van Gogh Foundation and the State of the Netherlands, in which the preservation and management of the collection, and its placing in the Rijksmuseum Vincent van Gogh, to be realized in Amsterdam, is entrusted to the State; given on loan until the opening of the museum on 2 June 1973 to the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam; on permanent loan to the Rijksmuseum Vincent van Gogh from 2 June 1973 and at the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam, since 1 July 1994.","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","https://vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection?Type=painting","localhost","localhost","localhost","https://vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection?Genre=cityscape","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","https://vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection?Date=1887","localhost","localhost","localhost","https://vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection?Place=Paris","localhost"

This celebrated landscape painter had lived in Auvers. So when Vincent arrived in the village, he went to see Daubignys home and garden as soon as he could. This is Van Goghs first painting of the garden. He later made two larger ones on canvas. Because Van Gogh did not have any canvas at hand, he painted the garden on a red and white striped tea towel. He first covered the towel with a bright pink ground layer of lead-white pigment mixed with red. This pink base formed a vivid contrast with the green paint he used for the garden. The ground layer is visible between the strokes of paint.

He was experimenting with what he called the laws of colour described by the French painter Eugene Delacroix (1798-1863). According to this theory, colours like red and green form a pair.

He was training at the time under Anton Mauve, a famous artist and his cousin by marriage. In Mauves studio, Vincent was permitted to paint this work in oils right away. For a student artist, this was a fairly rare opportunity. The painting was primarily an exercise in colour, surfaces and brushwork.

He needed models so that he could practise portrait painting. Only ladies of easy virtue could be persuaded to pose for a painter they had never met before.

The brothers, namely, bore a striking resemblance to one another. Unfortunately, there is no decisive evidence to determine who is actually portrayed, which is why the painting now has a double title. The portrait is unusually small and painted in considerable detail. Van Gogh was probably trying to compete with portrait photos.

He left out the main figure: Christ with his arm raised. Van Gogh focused on the theme of human suffering. He probably identified with Lazarus in the tomb. That would explain why he gave the figure a red beard. The two women by the grave are two acquaintances from Arles: Mrs Roulin, in the green dress, and Mrs Ginoux, in a dark dress with colourful stripes. A few of the pigments have faded considerably.

He intensified the emotional charge of his works by combining colours to create harmony on the one hand, or contrast on the other. 72.0 cm x 91.0 cm, 90.7 cm x 109.7 cm Donated by the artist or his brother Theo van Gogh, Paris to Doctor Gachet, Auvers-sur-Oise, after May 1890; after his death on 9 January 1909 inherited by his son and daughter Paul and Marguerite Gachet, Auvers-sur-Oise; gift of Paul Gachet jr. to the (1st) Vincent van Gogh Foundation, Laren, May 1954; transferred by Vincent Willem van Gogh to the (2nd) Vincent van Gogh Foundation, Amsterdam, on 10 July 1962 (ratified 28 December 1970); agreement concluded on 21 July 1962 between the Vincent van Gogh Foundation and the State of the Netherlands, in which the preservation and management of the collection, and its placing in the Rijksmuseum Vincent van Gogh, to be realized in Amsterdam, is entrusted to the State; given on loan until the opening of the museum on 2 June 1973 to the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam; on permanent loan to the Rijksmuseum Vincent van Gogh from 2 June 1973 and at the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam, since 1 July 1994.","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","https://vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection?Type=painting","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost"

The Moulin de la Galette was popular among artists. They went there to dance and drink but also liked to paint there. Van Gogh lived nearby. He made a number of drawings and paintings on the grounds of the mill. After dark, the narrow street was filled with people out for a good time.

When he felt up to it, he would go outside to draw or paint. If you zoom in, you can see that Van Gogh made this drawing on pink paper. Thats especially clear when you look at the floor in the foreground. There you can also see the black chalk lines of the underdrawing. He painted over that drawing in oils. 61.6 cm x 47.1 cm With his brother Theo van Gogh, Paris, after October 1889; after Theos death on 25 January 1891, inherited by his widow, Jo van Gogh-Bonger, and their son, Vincent Willem van Gogh, Paris; administered until her death on 2 September 1925 by Jo van Gogh-Bonger, Bussum/Amsterdam/Laren; given on loan by Vincent Willem van Gogh, Laren to the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam, since 22 October 1931; transferred by Vincent Willem van Gogh on 10 July 1962 to the Vincent van Gogh Foundation, Amsterdam; agreement concluded on 21 July 1962 between the Vincent van Gogh Foundation and the State of the Netherlands, in which the preservation and management of the collection, and its placing in the Rijksmuseum Vincent van Gogh, to be realized in Amsterdam, is entrusted to the State; given on loan until the opening of the museum on 2 June 1973 to the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam; on permanent loan to the Rijksmuseum Vincent van Gogh from 2 June 1973 and at the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam, since 1 July 1994.","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","https://vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection?Type=drawing","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost"

The words translate as digger in a potato field, February. He probably intended to produce a traditional series of pictures of work on the land, one for each month of the year. From his letters, we know that Van Gogh did not in fact draw this raw-boned peasant in February, but in the summer of 1885.

Van Gogh preferred subjects with a working-class appearance. He made a large series of studies of heads like these, partly to practise depicting faces and expressions. In the case of this old man, he was successful: his sunken cheeks and the weary look in his eyes seem completely authentic. In this drawing, Van Gogh used many different shades of black.

He believed it to be a deaths head moth, its coloration astonishingly distinguished: black, grey, white, shaded, and with glints of carmine or vaguely tending towards olive green; its very big.. . He drew the moth with black chalk, paying considerable attention to the details. He applied the tone of the wings by carefully rubbing the chalk away. Van Gogh used a fine pen and brown ink to fill in the legs and antennae, added a few little lines to the wings and drew an extra outline around them. He accentuated the dark parts of the moth by thickly applying brown ink. He used the same ink with a pen and brush to draw a frame around the image. There was a particular reason Van Gogh drew the emperor moth rather than painting it, as [he wrote](http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let776/letter.html) to Theo: To paint it I would have had to kill it, and that would have been a shame since the animal was so beautiful.

And while my illness was at its worst, I still painted, among other things a reminiscence of Brabant, cottages with mossy roofs and beech hedges, [he wrote](http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let864/letter.html) in April 1890.. . This drawing shows Dutch-style houses with low hedges in the hilly landscape around Saint-Remy. Van Gogh usually took reality as the starting point for his art, but here he merges that reality with memories of his native region. He placed agricultural labourers a frequent theme of his in the Netherlands prominently in the foreground. He was not so impressed, however, by southern French peasants. In our country one sees men, women, children, animals at work everywhere and at all times of the year, and here not a third of that, and in addition theyre not the honest workers of the north.

He used a thin pen for the grass and a thicker one for the shrubs. The direction of the pen strokes also differs for each type of vegetation. This gives each one its own distinct character.

It is easy to imagine Van Gogh sitting in the corner of an outdoor cafe in Paris, sketching the benches, the gnarled trees and the customers. The somewhat gloomy atmosphere of the work comes from the brownish-yellow discolouration of the paper. At the edges, you can see that the paper was originally blue-grey. It must once have had a fresher appearance. Van Gogh made this drawing in pencil, pen and brush and ink. He used white chalk to add a few light accents in the sky. 38.7 cm x 52.5 cm Left by the artist at the apartment of his brother Theo van Gogh, Paris, February-March 1887; after Theos death on 25 January 1891, inherited by his widow, Jo van Gogh-Bonger, and their son, Vincent Willem van Gogh, Paris; administered until her death on 2 September 1925 by Jo van Gogh-Bonger, Bussum/Amsterdam/Laren; given on loan by Vincent Willem van Gogh, Laren to the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam, since 22 October 1931; transferred by Vincent Willem van Gogh on 10 July 1962 to the Vincent van Gogh Foundation, Amsterdam; agreement concluded on 21 July 1962 between the Vincent van Gogh Foundation and the State of the Netherlands, in which the preservation and management of the collection, and its placing in the Rijksmuseum Vincent van Gogh, to be realized in Amsterdam, is entrusted to the State; given on loan until the opening of the museum on 2 June 1973 to the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam; on permanent loan to the Rijksmuseum Vincent van Gogh from 2 June 1973 and at the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam, since 1 July 1994.","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","https://vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection?Type=drawing","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","https://vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection?Genre=cityscape","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","https://vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection?Date=1887","localhost","localhost","localhost","https://vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection?Place=Paris","localhost"

Van Gogh probably made them when he pinned up the sheet. In the late summer of 1887, Van Gogh painted sunflowers for the first time.

It was his first paid commission after becoming an artist less than two years earlier. This work is a portrait of part of the stately old city of The Hague: the bridge at the corner of Herengracht and Prinsessegracht. Van Gogh had a hard time drawing the bridge in accurate perspective. So he changed its shape slightly, as shown by a photograph of the same bridge.

But this blade of grass leads him to draw all the plants then the seasons, the broad features of landscapes, finally animals, and then the human figure, [he wrote](http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let686/letter.html). He admired that approach and sought to achieve something similar in his own work. Van Gogh described this drawing in [a letter](http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let782/letter.html) to his brother Theo as a hasty study (letter 782). All the same, he rendered the tassel hyacinths in considerable detail, opting for the Japanese manner and drawing the little flower buds close-up, against a blank background. He went over the pencil lines in brown ink using a fine brush. Van Gogh painted Tassel Hyacinths shortly after entering the psychiatric institution at Saint-Remy. Drawing a precise floral study like this might have helped comfort and sooth him. [He wrote](http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let785/letter.html) a few months later that in order to calm himself, he would gaze at a blade of grass, a pine-tree branch, an ear of wheat. 41.2 cm x 30.9 cm Sent by the artist from Saint-Remy-de-Provence to his brother Theo van Gogh, Paris, at the end of May 1889; after Theos death on 25 January 1891, inherited by his widow, Jo van Gogh-Bonger, and their son, Vincent Willem van Gogh, Paris; administered until her death on 2 September 1925 by Jo van Gogh-Bonger, Bussum/Amsterdam/Laren; given on loan by Vincent Willem van Gogh, Laren to the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam, since 22 October 1931; transferred by Vincent Willem van Gogh on 10 July 1962 to the Vincent van Gogh Foundation, Amsterdam; agreement concluded on 21 July 1962 between the Vincent van Gogh Foundation and the State of the Netherlands, in which the preservation and management of the collection, and its placing in the Rijksmuseum Vincent van Gogh, to be realized in Amsterdam, is entrusted to the State; given on loan until the opening of the museum on 2 June 1973 to the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam; on permanent loan to the Rijksmuseum Vincent van Gogh from 2 June 1973 and at the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam, since 1 July 1994.","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","https://vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection?Type=drawing","localhost","localhost","https://vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection?Genre=still life","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost"

These may have been sketches for a painting; he drew himself several times from the same angle. 31.1 cm x 24.4 cm Left by the artist at the apartment of his brother Theo van Gogh, Paris, sometime between January and June 1887; after Theos death on 25 January 1891, inherited by his widow, Jo van Gogh-Bonger, and their son, Vincent Willem van Gogh, Paris; administered until her death on 2 September 1925 by Jo van Gogh-Bonger, Bussum/Amsterdam/Laren; transferred by Vincent Willem van Gogh, Laren, on 10 July 1962 to the Vincent van Gogh Foundation, Amsterdam (ratified 28 December 1970); agreement concluded on 21 July 1962 between the Vincent van Gogh Foundation and the State of the Netherlands, in which the preservation and management of the collection, and its placing in the Rijksmuseum Vincent van Gogh, to be realized in Amsterdam, is entrusted to the State; given on loan until the opening of the museum on 2 June 1973 to the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam; on permanent loan to the Rijksmuseum Vincent van Gogh from 2 June 1973 and at the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam, since 1 July 1994.","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","https://vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection?Type=drawing","localhost","https://vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection?Genre=portrait","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","localhost","https://vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection?Date=1887","localhost","localhost","localhost","https://vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection?Place=Paris","localhost"

This drawing is based on a black-and-white print of the painting. That led to minor misunderstandings. Take the grains of wheat that Van Goghs sower is scattering behind him.

He finally found someone who was willing to sit for a portrait. It was an infantryman from the elite corps known as the Zouaves. This is one of the drawings that he made of him. Van Gogh had difficulty with parts of the drawing: the cap, for example, appears to be sliding off the soldiers head. And the eyes and nose did not turn out well.
